hello! [my name's **Marijonas Minkus**, but most people call me **MJ**](https://512b.dev/mjm/portfolio).  
i'm an amateur software developer, in case my presence on this site didn't make it clear enough.

i am currently studying computer science, mathematics, and engineering in college ([college](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/college#English:_Q7533204), not the other one) at portsmouth. after this, i intend to take a computer science MEng, partially to further my skill, and partially because i like learning this stuff.

i've been programming since i was about nine years old. additionally, in my earlier years of learning, i was cursed with unlimited internet access, and so ended up with another (smaller, less hierarchically relevant) curse, that of being exposed to the Esoteric Programming community. essentially, Weird Code.

this has developed into a profound interest in just about every single field of programming that exists, but especially programming language design and low level systems development. (in my projects, those overlap far more often than you'd think. see [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) (i am unreasonably obsessed with Forth ([see hvm although heph itself isn't well documented](https://codeberg.org/ufrag/hvm))))

alongside my more mentally strenuous interests, i also started, own, and run [a website with a few of my dev friends from around the world](https://512b.dev/) (if by the world we, of course, are talking about Europe and a bit of the Middle East). they're very cool people and are all in some small part responsible for my interests.

(p.s., you may look at my repo-less account an think it's dodgy - all my projects are up on [my codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ufrag), not here! this account is for networking and contributions to projects hosted here)
